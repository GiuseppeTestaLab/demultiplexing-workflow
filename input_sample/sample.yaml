# example input file

# identifiers of the reference data to be used
# e.g. "cellranger_human_GRCh38-2020-A" for cellranger reference or "gencode_human_35" for GENCODE
ref: "..."

# name of the project, this label will be used to define the path where output files will be created
project: "..."

# output files will be written using this directory naming convention:
#                     {datapath}/scRNAseq/{type of data}/{project}_{reference}/{user}
# where: {datapath} is the root of the storage area (platform-dependent),
# {type of data} is a label to organize the output depending on the type of file (e.g. "demultiplexing", "reports"...)

# list of the samples, each listing the files that are required for the demultiplexing processing
# the keys that define the samples (here: "rep01") are chosen by the user
samples:

    # each sample should contain the following keywords:
    # bamfile: the path to the BAM file that has be obtained by the single-cell FASTQ alignment
    # vcf: the joint vcf with the multiplexed genotypes
    # barcodes: gzipped tsv or plain tsv file with the list of the cell barcodes
    # field: tag for genotypes
    # ngenotypes: number of genotypes in the multiplexed sample
    # filteredmatrix: path to the filtered_feature_bc_matrix in the cellranger aligned results
    # referencecall: file with the reference cell call to be included in the report
